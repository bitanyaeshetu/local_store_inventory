### Bonus Challenges

1. **Export to CSV**:
   You can implement a method in the `InventoryManagement` class to export the inventory to a CSV file using the `csv` module.

2. **Error Handling**:
   Use try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs, especially during database operations.

3. **Unit Tests**:
   Create a separate file for unit tests using the `unittest` framework to ensure key functions are tested.

This structure should give you a solid start on your project. If you have specific areas you'd like to expand on or any questions, feel free to ask!
